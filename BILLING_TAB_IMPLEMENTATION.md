# Billing Tab Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive billing and subscription management functionality using the Laravel backend API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Configuration (`lib/api-config.ts`)
Added new endpoint configurations for subscription and invoice management:

```typescript
SUBSCRIPTION: {
  DETAILS: "/subscriptions/details",
  CANCEL: "/subscriptions/cancel",
  RENEW: "/subscriptions/renew",
  EXTEND: "/subscriptions/extend",
  TRIAL: "/subscriptions/trial",
  UPDATE_PAYMENT: "/subscriptions/payment-method",
},
INVOICE: {
  LIST: "/invoices",
  DOWNLOAD: (invoiceId: string) => `/invoices/${invoiceId}/download`,
},
```

### 2. Billing Component (`components/dashboard/account/Billing.tsx`)

#### New State Management
- `invoices`: List of user invoices
- `trialData`: Trial subscription information
- `isLoadingInvoices`: Loading state for invoice fetching

#### New Data Fetching Functions
1. **`fetchSubscriptionData()`** - Fetches subscription details from backend
2. **`fetchInvoices()`** - Fetches billing history/invoices
3. **`fetchTrialData()`** - Fetches trial period information

#### Implemented Actions
1. **`handleCancelSubscription()`** 
   - Cancels active subscription with confirmation
   - Shows success/error toast notifications
   - Refreshes subscription data

2. **`handleRenewSubscription()`**
   - Renews subscription
   - Shows processing state with loading indicator
   - Updates UI after successful renewal

3. **`handleExtendSubscription()`**
   - Extends current subscription period
   - Displays success message from API response
   - Refreshes subscription data

4. **`handleUpdatePaymentMethod()`**
   - Placeholder for payment method update
   - Shows info toast (ready for future implementation)

5. **`handleDownloadInvoice(invoiceId)`**
   - Downloads invoice as PDF
   - Creates download link and triggers browser download
   - Shows success/error notifications

6. **`handleContactSupport()`**
   - Redirects to support page

#### UI Improvements

##### Trial Period Card
- Displays when user is on trial
- Shows trial end date
- Shows days remaining
- Provides "Upgrade Now" CTA

##### Subscription Plan Card
- Displays current plan name
- Shows credit usage with progress bar
- Shows renewal date
- Multiple action buttons:
  - Change Plan (links to pricing)
  - Extend Subscription
  - Renew Now (with refresh icon)
  - Cancel Subscription (destructive variant)
- All buttons show loading state when processing

##### Payment Method Card
- Updated to use CreditCard icon instead of hardcoded image
- Generic payment method display
- "Update Payment Method" button wired up

##### Billing History Card
- Dynamic invoice list from API
- Loading state while fetching invoices
- Empty state when no invoices found
- Each invoice shows:
  - Date (formatted)
  - Invoice number
  - Amount (if available)
  - Download button with icon

## API Endpoints Used

1. **GET** `/subscriptions/details` - Fetch subscription information
2. **GET** `/subscriptions/trial` - Fetch trial period details
3. **GET** `/invoices` - Fetch invoice list
4. **GET** `/invoices/{id}/download` - Download specific invoice
5. **POST** `/subscriptions/cancel` - Cancel subscription
6. **POST** `/subscriptions/renew` - Renew subscription
7. **POST** `/subscriptions/extend` - Extend subscription period

## Features Implemented

✅ Centralized API configuration
✅ Subscription details display
✅ Trial period information and display
✅ Cancel subscription functionality
✅ Renew subscription functionality
✅ Extend subscription functionality
✅ Invoice list with dynamic data
✅ Invoice download functionality
✅ Loading states and error handling
✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
✅ Responsive button states (loading, disabled)
✅ Empty states for no data scenarios

## User Experience Enhancements

1. **Loading States**: All async operations show loading indicators
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages with retry options
3. **Confirmations**: Destructive actions require user confirmation
4. **Feedback**: Toast notifications for all actions
5. **Visual States**: Buttons disable during processing to prevent double-clicks
6. **Trial Alerts**: Prominent display of trial information with upgrade CTA
7. **Progressive Enhancement**: Falls back gracefully when data is unavailable

## Technical Highlights

- Uses centralized `API_CONFIG` for all endpoints
- Consistent error handling across all API calls
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- React hooks for state management
- Proper cleanup and loading states
- Accessible UI with proper ARIA labels (via shadcn/ui components)

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. Implement actual payment method update flow (currently shows placeholder)
2. Add invoice filtering/search functionality
3. Add subscription upgrade/downgrade flow
4. Implement payment history chart/visualization
5. Add email receipt sending functionality
6. Implement refund request functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with active subscription
2. Test with trial account
3. Test with no subscription
4. Test cancel subscription flow
5. Test renew subscription flow
6. Test extend subscription flow
7. Test invoice download with various invoice IDs
8. Test error states (network failures, API errors)
9. Test with empty invoice list
10. Verify all loading states appear correctly
