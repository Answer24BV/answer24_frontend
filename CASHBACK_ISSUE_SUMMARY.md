# 🎯 Cashback Issue Summary & Solution

## The Problem
✅ Wallet shows €0 after purchase
❌ Cashback not being credited

## Root Cause Analysis

The cashback system has been fully implemented on the **frontend**, but the issue is likely on the **backend**:

### Most Likely Issue (95% Probability)

**Backend endpoint `/api/v1/wallet/add-money` is NOT IMPLEMENTED**

When user clicks "Buy Now":
1. ✅ Frontend calculates 10% cashback correctly
2. ✅ Frontend sends POST to `/api/v1/widget/track-purchase`
3. ✅ Frontend route processes and tries to call backend
4. ❌ Backend endpoint `/api/v1/wallet/add-money` returns **404 Not Found**
5. ❌ Wallet is never credited
6. ❌ Wallet page still shows €0

---

## 🔍 How to Confirm

### Step 1: Check Backend Endpoint Exists

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://answer24_backend.test/api/v1/wallet/add-money" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 10.00, "user_id": 190}' \
  -k -v
```

Look for the HTTP status line:

- **If you see `< HTTP/1.1 200`**: ✅ Endpoint exists, move to step 2
- **If you see `< HTTP/1.1 404`**: ❌ Endpoint doesn't exist, **CREATE IT!**
- **If you see `< HTTP/1.1 401`**: ⚠️ Auth issue with token
- **If you see `< HTTP/1.1 500`**: ⚠️ Server error in backend

### Step 2: Check Backend Route

In your Laravel backend directory:

```bash
php artisan route:list | grep wallet
```

You should see something like:

```
POST  /api/v1/wallet/add-money   WalletController@addMoney
```

**If you don't see it**, you need to create it.

### Step 3: Check Controller

In your Laravel backend, check if `WalletController@addMoney` exists:

```bash
grep -n "function addMoney\|def addMoney" app/Http/Controllers/WalletController.php
```

**If it doesn't exist**, you need to create it.

## ✅ Solution

### If Backend Endpoint Doesn't Exist

Create it in your Laravel backend:

**File: `routes/api.php`**
```php
Route::post('/wallet/add-money', [WalletController::class, 'addMoney']);
```

**File: `app/Http/Controllers/WalletController.php`**
```php
public function addMoney(Request $request)
{
    // Validate input
    $validated = $request->validate([
        'amount' => 'required|numeric|min:0.01',
        'user_id' => 'required|integer',
        'description' => 'nullable|string',
    ]);

    try {
        // Get authenticated user
        $user = User::findOrFail($validated['user_id']);
        
        // Add to wallet balance
        $user->wallet_balance += $validated['amount'];
        $user->save();
        
        // Create transaction record (optional but recommended)
        if (class_exists('\App\Models\Transaction')) {
            Transaction::create([
                'user_id' => $user->id,
                'type' => 'credit',
                'amount' => $validated['amount'],
                'description' => $validated['description'] ?? 'Wallet Credit',
                'balance_before' => $user->wallet_balance - $validated['amount'],
                'balance_after' => $user->wallet_balance,
            ]);
        }
        
        return response()->json([
            'success' => true,
            'data' => [
                'balance' => $user->wallet_balance,
                'transaction_id' => $user->id . '_' . time(),
            ]
        ]);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        return response()->json([
            'success' => false,
            'error' => 'Failed to add money: ' . $e->getMessage()
        ], 500);
    }
}
```

### If Controller Exists But Doesn't Update Database

Check that it:
1. ✅ Authenticates the request (checks Bearer token)
2. ✅ Finds the user by `user_id`
3. ✅ Updates `wallet_balance` column
4. ✅ Saves to database
5. ✅ Returns JSON response with success and new balance

---

## 📊 Frontend Implementation (Already Done)

The frontend is already fully implemented:

### ✅ Files Modified

1. **`app/[locale]/(cashback)/webshop/[id]/WebshopDetailClient.tsx`**
   - Calculates 10% cashback when "Buy Now" is clicked
   - Sends request to `/api/v1/widget/track-purchase`
   - Shows success/error notifications

2. **`app/api/v1/widget/track-purchase/route.ts`**
   - Processes purchase tracking
   - Calls backend `/api/v1/wallet/add-money`
   - Logs all steps for debugging

3. **`app/[locale]/dashboard/wallet/WalletPageClient.tsx`**
   - Fetches wallet balance from `/api/v1/wallet/balance`
   - Displays balance to user

---

## 🎯 Testing After Fix

After you've created/fixed the backend endpoint:

### Step 1: Test Backend Directly
```bash
curl -X POST "https://answer24_backend.test/api/v1/wallet/add-money" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 5, "user_id": 190}' -k
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "balance": 5.00,
    "transaction_id": "..."
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Test via Frontend
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/nl/webshop/1
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Click "Buy Now"
5. Watch for success messages with ✅

### Step 3: Verify Wallet
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/nl/dashboard/wallet
2. Should show €10 (or 10% of purchase price)
3. ✅ Done!

## 📋 Debugging Guide

If it still doesn't work after creating the endpoint:

1. **Check frontend console (F12 → Console)**
   - Look for 🛒 🛒 BUY NOW CLICKED messages
   - Look for 💰 cashback amount
   - Look for ❌ any errors

2. **Check frontend network tab (F12 → Network)**
   - Look for `/api/v1/widget/track-purchase` request
   - Check status (should be 200)
   - Check response body

3. **Check backend logs**
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```
   - Look for wallet credit attempts
   - Look for any errors

4. **Check database directly**
   ```bash
   # Check if user's wallet was updated
   SELECT id, wallet_balance FROM users WHERE id = 190;
   ```
