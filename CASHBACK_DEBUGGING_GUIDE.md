📥 Full API Response: {success: true, data: {...}}
✅ SUCCESS! Cashback tracked and wallet should be credited

✅ Cashback tracked: {...}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting By Error

### Issue 1: Console Shows "BUY NOW CLICKED" But Then Nothing

**Problem:** API call might be failing silently

**Check:**
1. Network tab (F12 → Network)
2. Look for "track-purchase" request
3. Check the response

**Expected:**
- Request URL: `/api/v1/widget/track-purchase`
- Method: `POST`
- Status: `200`

**If Status is Not 200:**
```
❌ 400 Bad Request → Check user_id format
❌ 401 Unauthorized → Authentication issue
❌ 500 Server Error → Backend issue
❌ Network Failed → Backend not running
```

---

### Issue 2: "❌ No user data found in localStorage"

**Problem:** Not logged in or localStorage cleared

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Refresh page
3. Try again

**Check:**
```javascript
// In console, type:
localStorage.getItem('user_data')
// Should show your user data JSON, not null
```

---

### Issue 3: API Response Shows Error

**Example Error Output:**
```
❌ API returned failure: {
  success: false,
  error: "Invalid signature"
}
```

**Common Errors:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Invalid signature" | Development mode issue | Check if public_key is 'webshop-key' |
| "Missing required fields" | Invalid request body | Check console logs for Order details |
| "Backend not available" | Backend server down | Make sure backend is running |
| "User not found" | Wrong user ID | Check user_id in localStorage |

---

## 🔧 What to Check

### Check 1: User ID
```javascript
// In console:
let userData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user_data'));
console.log(userData.id);
// Should show a number like: 190
```

### Check 2: Price Calculation
```javascript
// Should be: 299.99 * 0.10 = 29.999 → rounds to 30.00
```

### Check 3: API Call
```javascript
// In Network tab, look for POST request to:
// /api/v1/widget/track-purchase
```

### Check 4: Backend Response
```javascript
// In Network tab, click the request
// Go to "Response" tab
// Should show: {"success": true, "data": {...}}
```
