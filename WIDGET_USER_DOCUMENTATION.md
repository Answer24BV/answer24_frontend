## Best Practices

### Design & User Experience

#### Color Selection

**Do:**

- ✗ Write long paragraphs
- ✗ Use technical jargon
- ✗ Sound robotic or impersonal

#### Widget Placement

**Recommended:**
- Bottom-right corner (standard, expected location)
- Bottom-left corner (if right side is crowded)

**Avoid:**
